# REFLECTION on AI Agent Usage

During the development of the FuelEU Maritime compliance platform, I utilized AI agents extensively to assist in code generation, refactoring, and testing. This reflection highlights my experience, learning, and areas for improvement.

## What I Learned Using AI Agents

AI agents such as GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, and Cursor Agent significantly accelerated the development process. I learned how to structure prompts effectively to get meaningful outputs and how to combine multiple agents for different tasks. For instance, Copilot provided quick inline completions for boilerplate code, while Claude Code was particularly helpful for generating complex TypeScript use-cases and refactoring existing code. Cursor Agent allowed task-based code generation, which made iterative development and corrections faster.

## Efficiency Gains vs Manual Coding

Using AI agents reduced the time required to write repetitive boilerplate code and implement standard CRUD operations by approximately 40-50%. The agents also suggested optimal patterns that improved code readability and adherence to the hexagonal architecture. While manual coding required continuous reference to documentation for Prisma, TypeScript types, and API contracts, AI agents provided immediate contextual suggestions, which streamlined both backend and frontend development.

## Improvements I Would Make Next Time

1. **Better Prompt Refinement:** Spending more time refining initial prompts would further reduce incorrect or partially incorrect outputs.
2. **Incremental Validation:** Integrate AI outputs in smaller chunks with immediate testing to catch errors early.
3. **Combining Multiple Agents Strategically:** I would plan which agent to use for each type of task in advance, rather than switching ad hoc.
4. **Documentation Automation:** Explore using AI to generate initial Markdown documentation, which can later be customized.

Overall, AI agents were highly effective in accelerating development, but careful oversight, iterative validation, and prompt engineering remain essential to maintain code quality and correctness.
